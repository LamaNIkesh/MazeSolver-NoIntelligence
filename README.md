# arduinoWallFollower
This sketch implements a simple wall following algorithm using PID controller as a feedback control system.
There are two switchButtons that allows the user to choose which wall to follow as per the maze.
Also the robot can be manually controlled via an android app developed using MIT app inventor.

* two continuous servo motors driven by a 6.6 V external battery pack.
* arduino uno powered by 9 v battery.
* two IR sensros and one sonar sensor to sense the surroundings
* a 5v voltage regulator to regulate the voltage from the 6.6 v battery pack
* RN42 bluetooth module 
* push buttons
